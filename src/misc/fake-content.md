This video was posted in the #yab-general channel on the nkweb server by an anonymous account, which quickly removed it and left the server not long after. It was presumed by some to be made by Yabujin; however, it was actually made by <b>taconiel</b>, who expressed remorse for making and publishing the video.

The voice lines remixed in the title screen BGM were taken from Hydra (10:55 timestamp).

The title screen image is taken from the game <i>Changed</i>:
