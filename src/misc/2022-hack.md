# March 2022 hack

On the 8th of March 2022, at approximately 21:40 CEST, Yabujin's SoundCloud account was hacked. The hackers did two things:

- Uploaded a song titled `𝔇𝔍 6YRథ్‌٣٣A ЗАО - 15 𝓫𝓪𝓷𝓲𝓮𝓴` (this is a reupload of [INSERT NAME HERE])
- Added the following to the bio:

![huj.wtf // klaudiusz ratajczak was here with aethus 08.03.2022 // yabujin please change your password](2022-hack-description.png)

The hack was primarily done by szv, who owns [huj.wtf](https://huj.wtf) (as mentioned in the description). The password was found in an unrelated publically available dump of a data breach.

According to him, the purpose of the hack wasn't to do any harm; rather, it was to notify Yabujin about his data being available before anyone else could use it.

This information was then forwarded by szv to sticki, who was able to reset the passwords and notify Yabujin about the breach.

By the next morning, everything had been resolved; an interesting side effect is that Yabujin also removed the links from his SoundCloud bio.
