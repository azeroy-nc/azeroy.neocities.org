# Azeroyska

Many of Yabujin's videos - primarily the Azeroy series - use a constructed language created by Yabujin specifically for the videos. This language will be refered to as Azeroyska.

Azeroyska takes inspiration from many languages - it's most similar to Slavic languages (keep in mind Yabujin himself is Lithuanian), but also has words that are partially borrowed from English and Portugese.

Most of those videos also use a special alphabet
