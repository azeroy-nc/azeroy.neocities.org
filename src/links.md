## Instagram

**Yabujin does not currently have an active Instagram account.** There are a handful of accounts he used to own, but most of these were squatted (usernames were taken by someone else). These include `za0za_0` and `16.88_yabujin_azeroy.hex`

# Reupload channels and bootlegs

*For the section about uploads often claimed to be Yabujin's, see [Fake content].*

## Trusted reupload channels

These channels have other content besides just Yabujin's stuff, but you're likely to come across them when looking up his videos:

- [Needle](https://www.youtube.com/c/Needleee) - mostly archived music videos, plus a couple of old SoundCloud uploads
- [karma archives](https://www.youtube.com/c/karmaarchives) - pretty much all the videos, including some rare stuff from before the Yabujin alias
- [dismiss yourself](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF81AytfSxkAMGjKFnsswnA) - official distributor for Yabujin's music on Spotify (see: [Yabujin - Topic](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ1TkqC1HAVOid-IKtcFHMQ))

## Bootlegs

There are various unofficial Yabujin song compilations on YouTube; this doesn't necessarily mean they contain fake songs, but rather that they simply weren't made by Yabujin.

Here's a couple of reccomendations:

- [Dismiss Yourself - Early Works Bootleg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPdfkKwel6g) - perhaps one of the most well-known bootlegs; while Sticki has said he isn't that proud of it anymore (citation needed), it serves as a pretty good introduction to Yabujin's earlier SoundCloud uploads.
- [OH_minuss - yabujin/dj gyrotta zao Hardstyle Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5fQg6WxFlc) - pretty good mix of DJ Gyrotta Zao, including some rare tracks and extended versions of snippets.

## Other fan-made works

- [b1eed1ng](https://www.youtube.com/@b1eed1ng/featured) - lyric videos/AMVs for various songs, including some of Yabujin's tracks.
